# 💡 DAG-Based ETL Pipeline for Sales Reporting

## 🧠 Project Description

This project automates the **extraction**, **transformation**, and **export** of sales data using `Apache Airflow`. It pulls **data** from a **PostgreSQL** database, enriches it with **USD to CLP exchange rate** information, and **exports** the final dataset to both a **CSV file** and a **Google Sheet**.

<br>

The **pipeline** is designed as a **Directed Acyclic Graph** (`DAG`) to manage task dependencies and ensure a reliable and repeatable workflow.

## 🧩 What This Project Does

- **Extracts** data from a PostgreSQL database using a custom SQL query.

- **Fetches** the current USD to CLP exchange rate from a public API.

- **Enriches** the data by converting sales totals from USD to CLP.

- **Exports** the final dataset:

    - as a CSV file (`report.csv`)

    - to a Google Sheet

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python

- Apache Airflow

- PostgreSQL

- Google Sheets API

- Docker (via `docker-compose`)

- Pandas, Requests, Matplotlib

---

## 🗂️ What's DAG?

A **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** is a graph where:

1. **Directed:** All edges have a direction (from one node to another)

2. **Acyclic:** No cycles exist—you can’t loop back to a previous node

---

### 📋 Common Uses of DAGs:

- Task scheduling (e.g., Airflow, build systems like Make)

- Version control systems (`e.g., Git`)

- Data processing pipelines

- Compilers and expression trees

---

## 🚀 Installation and Execution

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/CamilaJaviera91/dag-first-approach.git
cd dag-first-approach
```

2. Create a Virtual Environment:

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Configure Environment Variables:

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:

```
DB_HOST=your_database_host
DB_PORT=your_database_port
DB_NAME=your_database_name
DB_USER=your_database_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
DB_SCHEMA=your_database_schema #optional

GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=your_google_sheet_id
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE=path/to/your/service_account.json
```

5. Initialize the Airflow Database:

```
airflow db init
```

6. Set Up Google Sheets API

    - Follow this [guide](https://developers.google.com/workspace/sheets/api/quickstart/python?hl=es-419) to:

        1. Create a project in Google Developers Console.

        2. Enable the **Google Sheets API** and **Google Drive API**.

        3. Download the service account JSON credentials

        4. Set the path to this file in `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_PATH`.

    - Make sure to share your target Google Sheet with the service account email.

7. Run the main script:

```
python main.py
```

8. Start Airflow Services:

```
airflow webserver --port 8080
airflow scheduler
```

9. Access the Airflow Web Interface:

Navigate to http://localhost:8080 in your web browser.

## 📝 Script Functions

1. `connection()`

- **Establishes** a connection to the PostgreSQL database.

- **Returns:** `conn`, `cur` on success; `None, None` on failure

2. `extract_data()`

- **Runs** an SQL query to extract and aggregate sales data.

- **Returns:** `DataFrame` of extracted data

3. `fetch_usd_to_clp()`

- **Fetches** the current USD to CLP exchange rate.

- **Returns:** `float` (exchange rate) or `None` on failure

4. `enrich_report(df_usd, clp_rate)`

- **Adds** a CLP total to the report using the fetched exchange rate.

- **Returns:** Enriched `DataFrame`

5. `export_results(df)`

- **Saves** the enriched data as `results/report.csv`

6. `export_to_google_sheets(df, sheet_name, spreadsheet_name)`

- **Exports** the data to a `Google Sheet`

---

## ▶️ Execution Example

- Run de pipeline: 

```
python dag_postgres.py
```

- You'll see output like:

```
✅ Successfully connected to PostgreSQL.
💱 Exchange rate: 1 USD = 900.50 CLP
📊 Enriched report:
📤 Exported report to 'report.csv'
📤 Data exported to Google Sheets: Sales Report -> ReportSheet
🔒 Connection closed successfully.
```

## 📂 Output Files

- results/report.csv

- Google Spreadsheet: `Sales Report → ReportSheet`

---

## ❗Troubleshooting

- **Connection Errors:** Check your database credentials and network access.

- **Google Sheets Permissions:** Make sure the service account has access to edit the target sheet.

- **Missing Environment Variables:** Ensure `.env` is properly set and loaded.

---

## 📝 Notes

- Ensure the database is accessible and credentials are valid

- The service account must have permission to edit the target Google Sheet

- You can customize the SQL query, filenames, and sheet names

## 📘 How to Add a DAG to Apache Airflow and Display It in the Webserver

Follow these steps to add your `DAG` to Apache Airflow and make it visible in the Airflow web interface.

1. 📂 **Place Your DAG in the dags Directory**

Airflow loads DAGs from a specific folder, typically located at:

```
~/airflow/dags/
```

- If you've changed the path in your `airflow.cfg` (`dags_folder`), use that custom directory instead.

2. 📝 **Create Your DAG File**

Create a new Python file inside the dags folder. For example:

```
~/airflow/dags/my_example_dag.py
```

3. 🔁 **Restart Airflow Services**

After placing your DAG file, restart the Airflow scheduler and webserver:

```
airflow scheduler
airflow webserver
```

4. 🌐 **Open the Airflow Web UI**

Visit the Airflow UI in your browser:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

- You should see your DAG (`my_example_dag`) listed. Enable it and trigger it as needed.

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting in how to Add a DAG to Apache Airflow

If your DAG doesn't appear:

- ✅ Ensure the file ends with .py

- ✅ Make sure dag_id is unique and the syntax is valid

- ✅ Confirm it's located in the correct dags_folder

- ✅ Check the Airflow scheduler logs for errors:

```
airflow scheduler --log-level INFO
```
